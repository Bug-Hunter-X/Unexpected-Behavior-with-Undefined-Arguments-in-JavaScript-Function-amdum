This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: not handling undefined arguments.  The `foo` function is designed to accept two arguments, and it correctly handles null values.  However, it does not handle the case where one or both of the arguments are undefined. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected results. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly check for undefined values and handle them appropriately, avoiding potential issues.
